# Release notes: The Ferryman v0.3 browser prototype

Build date: 2026-09-27. Availability checked 2026-09-29: the playable folder is present, but the originally reported `outputs/The_Ferryman_Digital_Demo_v0.3.zip` is absent from this checkout. Use [index.html](index.html) with the folder intact. A distributable ZIP would need to be rebuilt and verified from the current folder. Evidence below describes the original build, not a new test run.

## What is in this build

- Endless run on a five-stop map with multiple destinations per cycle, haven and return.
- Boarding, calming, delivery with a preview, free memories with optional marks, repairs, wraith release, rocky routes, cycle-end forecast, three failure endings, no victory screen.
- Hidden events revealed when they happen, with a separate spoiler reference kept across runs and a Clear discoveries control.
- Automatic save and resume, New run, JSON export and import.

## Evidence (agent automation, not human play)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Engine tests `node --test "tests/engine/*.test.js"` | 126 / 126 pass (Node v26.8.1, macOS) |
| Integration checks `tests/integration/integration-check.cjs` | 15 / 15 pass |
| Browser flows `tests/integration/browser-flows.cjs` (real engine, clicks, headless Chrome) | 30 / 30 pass |

## Known limits

- No human playtest, balance, enjoyment, real-phone or multi-browser evidence.
- Engine worker's scripted "courier" policy survived 60 cycles with no wraiths (`verification/engine/policy-experiment-results.json`). The default numbers may be easy for a player who delivers every cycle. This is a team question; nothing was rebalanced.
- Art is about 67 MB of full-size PNGs; first load from disk is slower than it needs to be.
- The originally reported ZIP excluded Worker A's two archival art-pack ZIPs (`assets/art/*.zip`, 121 MB). They are not used by the game and remain in the repository folder.
